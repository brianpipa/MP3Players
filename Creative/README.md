# CreativeZen
A repository for reviving and updating Old Creative Zen Mp3 players, including Touch, Micro, and Vison:M

In November of 2024, I went through the process of updating and replacing the drives on a Creative Zen Micro, a Creative Zen Touch, and a Creative Zen Vision:M. This is a repository of how to do this, files I needed, and the hardware I used.

Most of these files and the info are available elsewhere, but I wanted to put it all in one place.

More info is here: http://myvogonpoetry.com/wp/2024/11/09/creative-zen-mp3-player-firmware-and-hdd-upgrades/ along with the list of hardware I used. This info is also archived in https://github.com/brianpipa/CreativeZen/blob/main/Creative%20Zen%20MP3%20Player%20Firmware%20and%20HDD%20Upgrades.pdf
